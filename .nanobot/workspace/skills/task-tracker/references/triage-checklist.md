# Task Triage Checklist

A step-by-step checklist for logging a new bug or task.

## Checklist

1. **Classify**: Is this a bug (something broken), a feature (new capability), or a chore (cleanup/refactor)?

2. **Title**: Write a short, specific title (≤ 10 words).

3. **Goal**: One sentence describing the desired end state.

4. **Symptom / motivation**: For bugs: what breaks and when. For features: what user need it addresses.

5. **Suspected cause** (bugs only): What do you think is wrong?

6. **Blockers**: Does this depend on any existing task? List them.

7. **Assign a task number**: Find the highest existing task number in BACKLOG.md and increment by 1.

8. **Write the entry**: Use the canonical Task Header format from `references/schema.md`. Set status to "Not started".

9. **Do NOT write milestones yet** — that's the planning subagent's job.

10. **Append to BACKLOG.md** under the active tasks section (before "## Completed").

11. **Confirm**: Read back the entry you just wrote and verify it matches the schema.
