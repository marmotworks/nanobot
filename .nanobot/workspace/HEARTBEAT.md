# Heartbeat.md - the place where what you're always working on goes, your base active motivations

## Active Tasks

- [x] Review the BACKLOG.md and tasks in the tasks directory. Identify blockers or dependencies, and then issue subagents to get the tasks done. Keep the tasks directory up to date with efforts. Don't rework completed work unless it's an enhancement or a bugfix. If you have questions or need clarification, dispatch a subagent to do some tool-use research. If you use an image-capable agent, it can use playwright effectively. Find the answers to your questions. Confirm your plans with research.
- Review the nanobot codebase for sloppy patterns or practice; fix it. 
- Look for redundancy and if you find it, reduce it. 
- Add comments to the nanobot codebase so it's easy to understand, follow, and keep from making sloppy mistakes.
