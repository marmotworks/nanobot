## Operational Preferences

- **Codebase changes go directly to `/Users/mhall/Workspaces/nanobot/`** — never as overlays in `.nanobot/workspace/`
- **Primary agent loop is for discussion and oversight only** — delegate task execution to subagents
- **Favor rigorous task decomposition and milestone tracking** — break work into clear, verifiable steps
- **Write tests that validate intended behavior** — be critical of tests; prefer meaningful coverage over superficial coverage
- **Improve consistency wherever possible** — naming conventions, style, and structure should be resilient and easy for the agent to reason about
- **Follow existing conventions** in naming and code style; prefer clarity and predictability

## Work Context

- **Main Project**: nanobot — an AI assistant framework with subagent support, local LLM integration via LM Studio, Discord gateway, and skill system
